## i18n

It is a common practice to separate the actual strings from your application logic.
Chat bots are no different. Instead of explicitly returning full, hardcoded sentences from the sagas
it is better to use an i18n library. Here is how to do that with Flowchat.

As usual, achieving this kind of funcitonality is done by mapping either the `input`, `output` or
`state`. In this case we will be mapping the `output`.

### 1. Create translation files

Let's assume we have following translation files:

#### i18n/en.json

```json
{
  "greeting": "Hello, user!"
}
```

#### i18n/pl.json

```json
{
  "greeting": "Witaj, uÅ¼ytkowniku!"
}
```

### 2. Create a "hello" flow

Next, create a simple "hello" flow that will run whenever the user sends a "hello" to the bot.
Here, however, instead of repying with an actual full sentence as we used to do so far, we will
reply with a `key` from the translation JSON files. No translation happens in the flow. It stays
simple and generic, working for all users and all languages.

#### flows/hello.js

```javascript
import { send } from 'flowchat';

const activator = (input, state) => input === 'hello';

const reducer = (input, state) => state;

const saga = function* (input, state, sessionId) => {
  yield send('greeting'); // send the i18n key rather than actual value
}

export const helloFlow = [activator, reducer, saga];
```

### 3. Create the app and map the output

The actual translation will happen once the bot outputs the key.

First, we get hold of the conversation state.

Next, we check what locale the user uses and we perform the translation.

Everything happens just before displaying the output.

#### flows/app.js

```javascript
import { Flowchat } from 'flowchat';

import { helloFlow } from './flows/hello.js';

const I18N = {
  en: require('./i18n/en.json'),
  pl: require('./i18n/pl.json')
};

const bot = new Flowchat();
const session = {};

bot.flow('/hello', ...helloFlow);

bot.state.subscribe(({ state, sessionId }) => session[sessionId] = state);

bot.output
  .map(({ data, sessionId }) => {
    const state = session[sessionId];
    return { data: I18N[state.locale][data], sessionId }; // translate the key into actual phrase
  })
  .subscribe(({ data, sessionId }) => {
    console.log(data);
  });

bot.input.onNext({ data: 'hello', state: { locale: 'en' }, sessionId: 1 });
// logs: "Hello, user!"
```

### 4. Middlewares

Such commonly used mappings can be considered similar to what middlewares are in
[express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and they can be extracted and shared as separate modules.

We say more about middlewares here [TODO].
