`redux-saga` is a library that aims to make side effects (i.e. asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) in React/Redux applications easier and better.

The mental model is that a saga is like a separate thread in your application that's solely responsible for side effects. `redux-saga` is a redux middleware, which means this thread can be started, paused and cancelled from the main application with normal redux actions, it has access to the full redux application state and it can dispatch redux actions as well.

It uses an ES6 feature called Generators to make those asynchronous flows easy to read, write and test. *(if you're not familiar with them [here are some introductory links](https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/ExternalResources.html))* By doing so, these asynchronous flows look like your standard synchronous JavaScript code. (kind of like `async`/`await`, but generators have a few more awesome features we need)

You might've used `redux-thunk` before to handle your data fetching. Contrary to redux thunk, you don't end up in callback hell, you can test your asynchronous flows easily and your actions stay pure.

# Getting started

## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save redux-saga
```
or

```sh
$ yarn add redux-saga
```

Alternatively, you may use the provided UMD builds directly in the `<script>` tag of an HTML page. See [this section](#using-umd-build-in-the-browser).

## Usage Example

Suppose we have an UI to fetch some user data from a remote server when a button is clicked. (For brevity, we'll just show the action triggering code.)

```javascript
class UserComponent extends React.Component {
  ...
  onSomeButtonClicked() {
    const { userId, dispatch } = this.props
    dispatch({type: 'USER_FETCH_REQUESTED', payload: {userId}})
  }
  ...
}
```

The Component dispatches a plain Object action to the Store. We'll create a Saga that watches for all `USER_FETCH_REQUESTED` actions and triggers an API call to fetch the user data.
